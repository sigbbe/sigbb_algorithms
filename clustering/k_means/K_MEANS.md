# K-means

## About

K-means is an entry level clustering approach. K-means is used in many fields. For instance, machine learning uses k-means clustering quite a lot. K-means is what we call an usupervised clustering method, the algorithm creates works from non-labeled training data. K-means is a parametric clustering algorithm. Simply put, K-means, partitions a given dataset into k clusters. K-means computes the mean position (centroid) of all partitions (clusters), and then, iteratively, works out where the ideal means should be. The algorithm runs until the new partitioning is the same as the one in the previous iteration.

Which factors have consequences for the output of the K-means algorithm?

- Number of centroids, k
- Starting position of the k centroids

Let's imagine we have some data randomly grouped up. If we want to split this data up
